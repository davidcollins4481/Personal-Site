                        Hello. This is my personal site to play around on, blog (when I get that set up), put on business cards, whatever. Please don't mistake
                        my casual tone with a lack of professionalism. As much as I want to create a place to point others to
                        for professional purposes, I also want a place to feel comfortable exploring tech topics and communicating
                        with others. I'm just getting this site set up so I imagine very people even know it exists. Probably a good thing right now I guess :)
                    </p>
